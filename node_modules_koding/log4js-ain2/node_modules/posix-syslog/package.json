  "readme": "posix-syslog\n============\n\nInterface to Syslog via the old, traditional posix syscalls. It just works.[1]\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\n\nvar syslog = require(\"posix-syslog\");\n\nsyslog.open(\"myApp\");\n\nsyslog.log(\"Wow, this is going to syslog!\");\nsyslog.crit(\"HELP! A Critical Message!\");\n\nsyslog.close();\n\n```\n\nThe syslog is also automatically opened (though with default configuration) if\nyou simply call to one of the logging functions without opening it manually.\n\n### Installation\n\n\tnpm install posix-syslog\n\n### Logging\n\nThe basic log functions available are defined by posix-syslog's masks:\n\n```javascript\nsyslog.emerg()\nsyslog.alert()\nsyslog.crit()\nsyslog.err()\nsyslog.warning()\nsyslog.notice()\nsyslog.info()\nsyslog.debug()\n```\n\n### Configuration & Options\n\nYou can pass options into `syslog.open`. These options follow the same format as\nthe [`posix.openlog` function.](https://github.com/melor/node-posix#posixopenlogidentity-options-facility)\n\nYou may want to configure the posix-syslog module to mirror what it sends to syslog\nto your STDOUT/STDERR. This is done via console.log/error/warn/info, and mapped\nto the syslog mask you specify. Simply set `syslog.mirror` to true, and the\nsyslog output will be mirrored to the console.\n\n### Licence (BSD)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013, Christopher Giffard\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n*\tRedistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list\n\tof conditions and the following disclaimer.\n*\tRedistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this\n\tlist of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or\n\tother materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\" AND \nANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT,\nINDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING,\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE,\nDATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE\nOR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF\nADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n\n### Fineprint\n\n[1] Provided node posix isn't busted on your computer.
