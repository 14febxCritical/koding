1. Docker Deamon needs to be run in TCP Mode. If UNIX sockets are used we
need to setup the client so it has access to the `docker` group which
maintains the the socket. So initiallty TCP is a good start.
2. TCP mode is enabled by adding "-H tcp://bind-ip:port" to
/etc/default/docker or DOCKER_OPTS
3. But only authenticated Client should access it over TCP, so we need to
generate TLS cert keys and let both the Deamon and Client use it.
4. The boot2docker guys are using this package:
https://github.com/SvenDowideit/generate_cert for it which we can also use.
5. Here is also some information on how to start the Docker Deamon securely
