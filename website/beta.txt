  <ol>
    <li>First of all, <a href="http://blog.koding.com/2012/07/welcome-to-koding-the-next-little-thing" target="blank">Welcome to Koding</a></li>
    <li>Please don't tweet individual problems, our followers don't enjoy 'hey @koding X is broken' '@user please try Y' kind of conversations, send an update here on Koding.</li>
    <li>This is beta, and some of your clicks will not get you to what you want.</li>
    <li>Please click on koding-bugs topic to see if the issue is already reported before submitting.</li>
    <li>Write a status update for any kind of feedback, tag it with koding-feedback or koding-bugs</li>
    <li>Applications are not ready yet, but they are 90% done.</li>
    <li>We will give you ability to buy servers where you can be the root user.</li>
    <li>We're working on Dropbox, dropbox style sharing, chat and online collaboration.</li>
    <li>We will be iterating on the social features of the site over the next weeks, content types (status updates, code shares, questions) and your profile will look much better very soon.</li>
    <li>We will work on Groups next. So you can form teams and work together on the same backend.</li>
    <li>Koding users created a <a href="http://kwiki.koding.com">wiki</a> look at it for other answers.</li>
    <li>Yes, we can use your help. If you're seriously in love with this project, just like we are, <a href="http://blog.koding.com/2012/06/we-want-to-date-not-hire/" target="blank">we want to date, not hire.</a></li>
