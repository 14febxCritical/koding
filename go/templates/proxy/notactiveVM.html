    <dl>
    	<dt>Is the server on?</dt>
    	<dd>
        Koding servers are provided for active development only. This means that they are not suitable for hosting blogs or production sites. To maintain a great experience for everyone, Koding will put inactive servers to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity. This prevents malicious and abusive users from utilizing Koding, allowing you to have faster and more stable servers.

    	<dt>Wrong domain/server configuration?</dt>
    	<dd>
        {{.}} might be pointing to an nonexistent server. You can correct this by logging in and checking your "Environment Settings". Make sure this domain name is pointing to a server that's healthy and serving a web site. (e.g. if you stop your webserver, or run it on a different port that we don't know about, this error can happen.)

    	<dt>Our servers are not doing okay</dt>

        If this is your server and you've done everything right, it's probably our fault. Please let us know at <a href="mailto:support@koding.com?subject=Malfunctioning VM&amp;body={{.}} is not functioning.">support@koding.com</a>
