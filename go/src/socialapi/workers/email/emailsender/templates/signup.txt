Hi {{ .UserID }},
       
My name is Devrim, the co-founder and CEO of Koding; I wanted to personally welcome you. You are now part of a growing community of pioneering developers who are writing software in the cloud! I thought it might be helpful to point out a few things before you get started.

New to software development? 

If you're just getting started with software development and have found Koding, then you are really going to enjoy Koding University (https://koding.com/docs/home). There you can find all kinds of answers about the features on Koding.com. Things like the following are covered in great detail:

* What is Koding and what can I do here?
* How can I create and run my first software application?
* Are there any videos I can watch to learn more about Koding?

Already familiar with software dev? 

Then you probably want to dive right in! Koding VMs are prepped and ready for you straight away. 

I also recommend you visit Koding University for guides that will be very helpful as you navigate Koding. You may also want to check out KPM (Koding Package Manager - https://koding.com/docs/getting-started-kpm) if you are looking to install and play with things like wordpress, joomla, MySQL, MongoDB, etc. KPM makes complex installations a one-line effort. 

Looking for help? 

Everyone gets stuck from time to time, it happens. If your question is related to Koding functionality, then find us via support@koding.com. However, if your question is related to something you are developing, share it with our active community (https://koding.com/Activity/Public/Liked) of developers! 

Whether you are beginner or an expert, we hope that Koding will be able to help you achieve your goals. 

Welcome, and enjoy!
