      <h4>Hosted on Amazon</h4>
      <p>Koding VMs are essentially Amazon VMs which means they carry with
      them the dependability that Amazon's cloud infrastructure is known for.
      Your Koding VM will be an Amazon t2.micro instance.</p>

      <h4>Docker</h4>
      <p>Koding VMs are not sliced up hosts running LXC. This means that
      you can easily run advanced technologies like Docker and still keep your file tree clean.
     </p>

      <h4>Ubuntu 14.04</h4>
      <p>Koding VMs run Ubuntu 14.04 and come with
      all the default packages and software that ship with a standard
      Ubuntu image (plus we have added a few more goodies).</p>
