nice to have features
=========
* move tabs to other panes (challenging, it might take some time to implement)
* basic image support, display image in editor (little bit tricky)
* reveal file in finder (easy to do, we can ship it with core feature set)
* git support (it's nice to have but hard to implement)
* support markdown files via preview (easy to do, we can ship it with core feature set)
* language specific features like go fmt, coffee2js, styl2css (it should be designed to be a plugin so users can contribute)
* emmet aka zen coding we got this feature request by million times. (there might be a technical challenge about requirejs)
* code snippet support (another plugin supported feature)
* file history with diff patch match (challenging)
* color picker (not really urgent)
* customisable keyboard shortcuts (easy to do but not a core feature)
