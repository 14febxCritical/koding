        <p>
          Your CPUs are shared among all your running VMs. If you run only
          one VM, all CPUs will be utilized; if you have 10 VMs running,
          they will share your available CPUs.

        <h5>RAM</h5>
        <p>
          Memory is shared between your running VMs. Each VM starts with
          allocated memory. If you have 10GB limit, you can run 10VMs at
          1GB, or 3 x 3GB and 1 x 1GB.

        <p>
          This is local storage allocated to your VMs. You can distribute
          this quota across all of your VMs as you need.You can allocate
          40GB of disk space to one of your VMs, for instance, and to the
          next one you could allocate 10GB.

          The maximum number of VMs that you can keep turned on 24/7. For example,
          you bought a package comes with 10 VMs and one always-on VM.
          The VM you mark as always-on will work 24/7 but the others will be taken
          into sleep automatically in 15 minutes after you logout.
