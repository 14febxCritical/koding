Hello,

Finally the wait is over. We have reached to the scariest moment of a startup, "here is our product".

Thank you for signing up to our list, thanks for giving us a chance. It means so much to us.

Please give me a moment if you like, I want to tell you why we built this project. "Welcome to Koding, the next little thing." it’s here: http://d.pr/SGu7

We had a nice write-up on TechCrunch too: http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/24/koding-launch/

Alright, here is your invite, we hope you will like what you see.

Now, go, code, share and have fun!

Devrim
on behalf of your friends at Koding.

notes:
- of course you can mail me back if you like...
- this is still beta, expect bugs, please don’t be surprised if you spot one.
- if you already have an account, you can forward this to a friend.
- no matter how you signed up, you will not receive any mailings, newsletters and other crap.
- if you’ve never signed up (sometimes people type their emails wrong, and it happens to be yours), please let us know.
