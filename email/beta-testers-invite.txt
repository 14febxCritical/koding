Hello,

Finally the wait is over. We have reached to the scariest moment of a startup where we say "here is our product!".

Thank you for signing up to our list, thanks for giving us a chance. It means so much to us.

Please give me a moment if you like, I want to tell you why we built this project. "Welcome to Koding, the next little thing." it’s here: http://d.pr/SGu7

We had a nice write-up on TechCrunch when we first launched back in July: http://techcrunch.com/2012/07/24/koding-launch/

Alright, here is your invite, we hope you will like what you see.

Now, go, code, share and have fun!

Whole Koding Team welcomes you,
Devrim, Sinan, Chris, Aleksey, Gokmen, Arvid, Richard and Nelson (yeah we're just 8)


notes:
- of course you can mail me back if you like... (says Devrim)
- this is still beta, expect bugs, please don’t be surprised if you spot one.
- if you already have an account, you can forward this to a friend.
- no matter how you signed up, you will not receive any mailings, newsletters and other crap.
- if you’ve never signed up (sometimes people type their emails wrong, and it happens to be yours), please let us know.
- take a look at http://wiki.koding.com for things you can do.
- if you fall in love with this project, please let us know - http://blog.koding.com/2012/06/we-want-to-date-not-hire/
