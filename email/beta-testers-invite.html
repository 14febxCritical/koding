Soon we&rsquo;ll be opening up a public beta version of Koding. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll be rolling out the beta by invitation for now. &nbsp;All we ask in return is that you help us out with feedback, testing and bug reports.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>As a beta tester, here&rsquo;s what you can expect:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>- Things will be buggy. Not all of your clicks will get you what you want.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>- We&rsquo;ll be constantly updating the system based on your feedback, and adding new features.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>- This is just the beginning. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ll be iterating and rolling out new features continuously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>- This is a real beta. &nbsp;Your data and files on the beta site may be lost. &nbsp;If you care about what you create, make sure to back it up :)</span></p><p class="c0"><span>- Our entire team will be there to help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>- We&rsquo;ve set up a private discussion area to report bugs and discuss all aspects of the beta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>- If you&rsquo;re a current Kodingen user, you can&rsquo;t register the same username</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>What to test:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>Right now we have our basic activity feed working, online editing, terminal, topic tags, databases and basic member profiles. Get crazy with it, and let us know what you think... what you like, what you hate, what&rsquo;s broken, etc.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Sound good? Let&rsquo;s get to it!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>If you think you&#39;ve found a potential security flaw, have problems accessing the site, or are unable to access the feedback forum, you can always shoot me an email and I&#39;ll try to help you out. Otherwise, if possible, use the &quot;beta feedback&quot; link on the site so the whole team can see your feedback and help you.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>So without further ado, here is your Koding private beta invite:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>#{url}</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Cheers!</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Devrim</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>P.S.
